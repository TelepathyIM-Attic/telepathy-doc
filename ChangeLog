	* docs/examples/list_contacts/: Added the beginnings of another example.
	So far it just tries to create the connection so it can later get the 
	contacts from it.

	* docs/examples/list_all_protocols/main.c: Asynchronously introspect 
        the connection manager for the protocols information if necessary, 
	though this raises many more questions.

	* docs/examples/list_all_protocols/main.c: Check whether the protocol 
	information has been introspected. Added TODOs wondering how/when to 
	get the information if it has not been introspected.
