2009-12-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/book/C/telepathy.xml: Basics: Optional Interfaces: Mention how 
	to check with telepathy-glib. We need dbus-glib and Python examples 
	here too.
	Connection: Added a Presence sub-section with the example.

2009-12-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/book/C/telepathy.xml: Basics: Optional Interfaces: Mention that 
	ConnectionManager and Channel also have optional interfaces (not just 
	Connection), and mention the new Interfaces property.

2009-12-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/book/C/telepathy.xml: Basics: API Conventions: Mention the 
	Request/Get distinction and link to the telepathy-glib conventions.
	Removed the Asynchronous Calls section because we dealt with that here 
	and in the Using D-Bus section.

2009-12-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/book/C/telepathy.xml: Basics: Handles: Write this section. 
	Removed the main Handles chapter because a) It was planned to cover the 
	same stuff and b) It should be covered very early.

2009-12-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/book/C/telepathy.xml: Basics: D-Bus, telepathy-glib: Explicitly 
	point out that we are dealing with proxies, not the objects themselves.
	Added a Headers and Linking sub-section.
	ConnectionManager chapter: Mention how to list connection managers and 
	their proxies, with links to the spec and reference documetnation. 
	Move the list_protocols example here.
	Connection: Mention RequestConnection() and the telepathy-glib 
	equivalent. 

2009-12-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/book/C/telepathy.xml: Basics: Correct the use of the indexterm 
	tags. Their contents are not displayed in the main text.

2009-12-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/book/C/telepathy.xml: Basics: telepathy-glib: Mention sync/async 
	prefixes. Mention generated/hand-coded prefixes. Mention 
	call_when_ready() functions.

2009-12-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/basics_dbus_glib/main.c:
	* docs/examples/basics_dbus_python/example.py: Call the D-Bus method 
	asynchronously instead of synchronously.
	* docs/book/C/telepathy.xml: Basics: Using D-Bus: Mention simple D-Bus 
	concepts. Mention asyncronous calls, and say how we do that in the 
	examples.
	Added an Installation chapter.
	Added an index and sprinkled some indexterm tags around to fill it.

2009-12-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/book/C/telepathy.xml: Basics: Add a Language Bindings sub-section 
	as a way to mention telepathy-glib, which we use (so far) for all our 
	examples.

2009-12-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/book/C/telepathy.xml: Basics: Move the boring stuff about 
	Introspect() into a notes section because it is too soon to get scary.

2009-12-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/book/C/telepathy.xml: Basics: Write some text about optional 
	interfaces. Added a Connection Managers section before it, so that we 
	see the point and so we can describe the Telepathy architecture briefly.

	* docs/book/C/icons/: Put the .png files in the folder instead of above.
	* docs/book/C/figures/: Tried adding this again, adding a README because 
	git seems to ignore it if it is empty.

2009-12-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* docs/examples/basics_dbus_python/Makefile.am:
	* docs/examples/basics_dbus_python/example.py
	* docs/book/C/telepathy.xml: Basics: Add a little example of calling a 
	D-Bus method with Python.

	* docs/book/insert-example-code.py: Read .py files as well as .h and .cc 
	files.

2009-12-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* docs/examples/basics_dbus_glib/Makefile.am:
	* docs/examples/basics_dbus_glib/main.c
	* docs/book/C/telepathy.xml: Basics: Add a little example of calling a 
	D-Bus method with dbus-glib.

	* docs/book/C/icons/:
	* docs/book/C/figures/: Added these directories to git. I forgot to do 
	that until now.

2009-12-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/book/C/telepathy.xml: Add a small part of the introduction. 
	Add some sect structure.

2009-01-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/send_message/main.c: on_get_contacts_by_id(): Ref the 
	TpContact so we can use it later, avoiding the crash when calling 
	tp_contact_get_handle().

2009-01-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/send_message/main.c: Set the TargetHandleType too, 
	though this then crashes: 
	https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19523
	(The previous mentioned error was fixed by upgrading telepathy-gabble.)

2008-01-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Do not null-terminated the array 
	given to tp_connection_get_contacts_by_handle() though I still get an 
	error about handle #2 having no contact-id.

2008-12-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/book/insert_example_code.pl: Base this on the gtkmm-documentation 
	one rather than the flumotion-doc one (but using .c, not .cc), to 
	read all files in a directory rather than individual files.
	* doc/book/Makefile.am: Call insert_example_code.pl with the correct 
	path.
	* doc/book/C/telepathy.xml: Add the examples at some vaguely 
	appropriate places, to check that this works.

2008-12-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/book/C/telepathy.xml: Define a base URL entity and use ulink to 
	link to types, interfaces and methods in the Telepathy specification.

2008-12-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/send_message/main.c: Implement code to get a text 
	channel and send a message on it, though (like the list_contacts example) 
	it does not work now due to this error from 
	tp_connection_get_contacts_by_id():
        Connection manager :1.171 is broken: contact #2 in the GetContactAttributes result has no contact-id

2008-12-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* docs/examples/Makefile.am
	* docs/examples/send_message/main.c:  Added the beginnings of a 
	an example to send a single message to a single specific contact.

2008-12-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/set_presence/main.c: 
	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Use the *_call_when_ready() 
	functions instead of *_run_until_ready().

2008-12-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/set_presence/main.c: Wait until the connection is 
	ready, so that setting of the presence can succeed. 

2008-12-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* docs/examples/Makefile.am
	* docs/examples/set_presence/: Added a (nonworking) example of 
	setting presence, by copying the connect example and adding a call.

2008-12-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Use *_call_* functions instead 
	of *_run_* functions because everybody says they should never be used.

2008-11-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Get other contact features, 
	to show aliases and presence.

2008-11-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Examine the actual contacts 
	handles as before rather than the handle for the list of contacts.
	This now works.

2008-11-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Use the new TpContacts API 
	instead, which seems much simpler than all that channel stuff.
	However, this currently gives this GError:
	handle 2 is not currently a valid contact handle (type 1)

2008-11-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Still trying to read the subscribed 
	contacts details. Without code changes, I now get a non-null list of 
	contacts, either because I am using a newer telepathy-glib or because 
	I upgrade to Ubuntu Intrepid. However, the attribures GHashTable is empty 
	for all contacts. 

2008-09-31  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Trying to read the subscribed 
	contacts details.

2008-09-31  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Get the ContactsList interface, 
	though I do not yet know how to get details for each contact via 
	the handle.

2008-09-31  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/connect/: Added this as a copy of the current 
	list_contacts. Connecting is complex enough that it deserves its own 
	example, before we make it more complex by adding other stuff.

2008-09-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: printf the reason as text.

2008-09-29  Will Thompson  <will.thompson@collabora.co.uk>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Only disconnect when the connected 
	status has been received in the callback, so the connection actually 
	has a chance to happen.

2008-09-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Try to catch connection problems 
	via the status_changed callback. 

2008-09-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/: Added the beginnings of another example.
	So far it just tries to create the connection so it can later get the 
	contacts from it.

2008-09-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_all_protocols/main.c: Asynchronously introspect 
        the connection manager for the protocols information if necessary, 
	though this raises many more questions. 

2008-09-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_all_protocols/main.c: Check whether the protocol 
	information has been introspected. Added TODOs wondering how/when to 
	get the information if it has not been introspected.
