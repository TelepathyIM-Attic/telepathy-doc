	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Do not null-terminated the array 
	given to tp_connection_get_contacts_by_handle() though I still get an 
	error about handle #2 having no contact-id.

2008-12-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/book/insert_example_code.pl: Base this on the gtkmm-documentation 
	one rather than the flumotion-doc one (but using .c, not .cc), to 
	read all files in a directory rather than individual files.
	* doc/book/Makefile.am: Call insert_example_code.pl with the correct 
	path.
	* doc/book/C/telepathy.xml: Add the examples at some vaguely 
	appropriate places, to check that this works.

2008-12-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/book/C/telepathy.xml: Define a base URL entity and use ulink to 
	link to types, interfaces and methods in the Telepathy specification.

2008-12-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/send_message/main.c: Implement code to get a text 
	channel and send a message on it, though (like the list_contacts example) 
	it does not work now due to this error from 
	tp_connection_get_contacts_by_id():
        Connection manager :1.171 is broken: contact #2 in the GetContactAttributes result has no contact-id

2008-12-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* docs/examples/Makefile.am
	* docs/examples/send_message/main.c:  Added the beginnings of a 
	an example to send a single message to a single specific contact.

2008-12-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/set_presence/main.c: 
	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Use the *_call_when_ready() 
	functions instead of *_run_until_ready().

2008-12-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/set_presence/main.c: Wait until the connection is 
	ready, so that setting of the presence can succeed. 

2008-12-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* docs/examples/Makefile.am
	* docs/examples/set_presence/: Added a (nonworking) example of 
	setting presence, by copying the connect example and adding a call.

2008-12-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Use *_call_* functions instead 
	of *_run_* functions because everybody says they should never be used.

2008-11-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Get other contact features, 
	to show aliases and presence.

2008-11-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Examine the actual contacts 
	handles as before rather than the handle for the list of contacts.
	This now works.

2008-11-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Use the new TpContacts API 
	instead, which seems much simpler than all that channel stuff.
	However, this currently gives this GError:
	handle 2 is not currently a valid contact handle (type 1)

2008-11-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Still trying to read the subscribed 
	contacts details. Without code changes, I now get a non-null list of 
	contacts, either because I am using a newer telepathy-glib or because 
	I upgrade to Ubuntu Intrepid. However, the attribures GHashTable is empty 
	for all contacts. 

2008-09-31  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Trying to read the subscribed 
	contacts details.

2008-09-31  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Get the ContactsList interface, 
	though I do not yet know how to get details for each contact via 
	the handle.

2008-09-31  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/connect/: Added this as a copy of the current 
	list_contacts. Connecting is complex enough that it deserves its own 
	example, before we make it more complex by adding other stuff.

2008-09-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: printf the reason as text.

2008-09-29  Will Thompson  <will.thompson@collabora.co.uk>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Only disconnect when the connected 
	status has been received in the callback, so the connection actually 
	has a chance to happen.

2008-09-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Try to catch connection problems 
	via the status_changed callback. 

2008-09-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/: Added the beginnings of another example.
	So far it just tries to create the connection so it can later get the 
	contacts from it.

2008-09-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_all_protocols/main.c: Asynchronously introspect 
        the connection manager for the protocols information if necessary, 
	though this raises many more questions. 

2008-09-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_all_protocols/main.c: Check whether the protocol 
	information has been introspected. Added TODOs wondering how/when to 
	get the information if it has not been introspected.
