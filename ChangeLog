	* docs/examples/contacts/: Added this as a copy of the current 
	list_contacts. Connecting is complex enough that it deserves its own 
	example, before we make it more complex by adding other stuff.

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: printf the reason as text.

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Only disconnect when the connected 
	status has been received in the callback, so the connection actually 
	has a chance to happen.

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/main.c: Try to catch connection problems 
	via the status_changed callback.

	* docs/examples/list_contacts/: Added the beginnings of another example.
	So far it just tries to create the connection so it can later get the 
	contacts from it.

	* docs/examples/list_all_protocols/main.c: Asynchronously introspect 
        the connection manager for the protocols information if necessary, 
	though this raises many more questions. 

2008-09-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/examples/list_all_protocols/main.c: Check whether the protocol 
	information has been introspected. Added TODOs wondering how/when to 
	get the information if it has not been introspected.
