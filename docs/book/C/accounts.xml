  <title>Accounts and AccountManager</title>
  <note>
   <para>
    The <interfacename>AccountManager</interfacename> and
    <interfacename>Account</interfacename> interfaces are implemented
    in <application>Mission Control 5</application>.
   </para>

   <para>
    <application>Mission Control 4</application> implements a completely
    different interface which is not documented here.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   The Account Manager is implemented as part of Mission Control and is
   responsible for keeping a list of accounts (e.g. XMPP/Jabber, IRC, MSN).
   The Account Manager is also responsible for maintaining the
   <link linkend="chapter.connection">Connection</link> to each account and
   setting the presence on that connection.
  </para>

  <para>
   The service is available on the session bus via the well-known bus name
   <literal>org.freedesktop.Telepathy.AccountManager</literal>, object
   <literal>/org/freedesktop/Telepathy/AccountManager</literal> and
   interface <literal>org.freedesktop.Telepathy.AccountManager</literal>.
  </para>

  <para>
   To get a list of all accounts known to the Account Manager, you can
   access the <property>ValidAccounts</property> and
   <property>InvalidAccounts</property> properties, both of which return an
   array of D-Bus objects. Valid accounts are accounts that are complete
   and usable for establishing a connection to a remote service. Invalid
   accounts are incomplete or otherwise unusable and cannot be used to
   establish a connection.
  </para>

  <!-- FIXME: example listing accounts -->

  <sect1 id="sect.accounts.accounts">
   <title>Accounts</title>
   <para>
    Account objects store off of the information that is used for making a
    <link linkend="chapter.connection">Connection</link> to a remote
    service. Mission Control can be used to establish connections for valid
    accounts.
   </para>

   <para>
    <interfacename>Account</interfacename> objects have object paths of the form
    <literal>/org/freedesktop/Telepathy/Account/cm/proto/acct</literal>
    where <literal>cm</literal> is the Connection Manager name (e.g. gabble,
    salut) and <literal>proto</literal> is the protocol name (as used in the
    object path of a <interfacename>Connection</interfacename>). Account
    objects implement the interface
    <literal>org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Account</literal>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Settings for an account are managed through D-Bus properties. To reduce
    D-Bus roundtrips: bulk read the properties with the standard
    <methodname>org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.GetAll</methodname> method;
    bulk set properties with the
    <methodname>org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Account.UpdateParameters</methodname>
    method. <xref linkend="table.accounts.account-properties"/> shows the
    properties of an <interfacename>Account</interfacename> object.
   </para>

   <para>
    Obtaining connections and managing the online/offline status of accounts
    is documented in
    <xref linkend="sect.connection.obtaining.account-manager"/>.

   <title>Managing Presence</title>

   <para>
    The Account Manager is responsible for managing the user's presence for
    each configured <interfacename>Account</interfacename>. The presence
    requested for an account also controls whether that account is connected or
    disconnected in Mission Control.
   </para>

   <para>
    The presence you desire for each <interfacename>Account</interfacename>
    should be set as that account's <property>RequestedPresence</property>
    property. The Account Manager will then attempt to set that presence on
    the account, connecting or disconnecting the account as required. The
    <property>CurrentPresence</property> property can be read to find out
    what the current presence of an account is.
   </para>

   <para>
    All presence properties in the Account Manager are of type
    <type>SimplePresence</type> (see
    <xref linkend="sect.connection.presence.simplepresence"/>).
   </para>

   <tip>
    <title>Who Is Responsible For Setting Presence?</title>
    <para>
     Application authors should be aware that lots of applications may be
     connected to the Telepathy service and may be interested in displaying
     or editing the user's presence; that some applications may allow more
     fine-grained control than others.
    </para>
    <para>
     The Telepathy specification does not delegate the task of setting the
     presence to any one client, or type of client. Applications should take
     care not to trample over the configured presence unneccesarily.
     Applications should not change the value of
     <property>RequestedPresence</property> (especially when starting up)
     unless it is because of a change by the user.
    </para>
    <para>
     Rather than requesting a default presence to bring themselves online,
     applications can ensure that they're brought online by requesting their
     channels from the Channel Dispatcher (for example, ensuring the
     ContactList channels).
    </para>
    <para>
     Telepathy allows for a separate presence per-Account (e.g. your work
     account might be Available/"In the Office" and your personal account
     might be Busy/"Working"). If a user interface cannot display or edit
     presence with this level of detail, it should provide some visual
     indication of this (i.e. similar to the way a checkbox might indicate
     an inconsistent state).

   Notes:
   - This is described in the telepathy specification but only partially 
     implemented in Nokia mission control.
   - AccountManager contains a list of my accounts (my jabber account, my 
     ICQ account, etc)
   - This is  a desktop-wide list of accounts shared by all applications (via 
     the Mission Control service)
     - most developers probably won't need to deal with them much.
   - This is not a list of remote accounts held by my contacts.
   - Includes the parameters which are passed to RequestConnection().
   - Includes some other parameters such as your avatar/your alias, which the 
     AccountManager takes care of setting for you
   - Responds to connectivity events/requests.
