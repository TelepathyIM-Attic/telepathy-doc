  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>The Telepathy framework allows applications to use real-time communications via several common protocols, such as XMPP (Jabber). For instance, an instant messenger application might use Telepathy to allow chats with online contacts via accounts with various IM services. Or a  game might use Telepathy to simplify the implementation of its networking code, allowing users to play against each other.</para>
  <para>Telepathy is a <ulink url="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus">D-Bus</ulink> API so it may be used from most programming languages.</para>
  <para>All this functionality is available under an open source license, allowing people to make improvements and add new features.</para>

  <para>TODO:  What are the benefits? How is it better than the alternatives? (If there are any). Is it easier, robuster, more secure, more flexible, cheaper, free-er, what?</para>

<!--
Notes:
- The following sections describe important D-Bus API in telepathy.
These sections will describe how these interfaces can be used, including small 
code snippets.
- Where possible the documentation will pull in small but complete 
code examples which can build as part of the documentation, guaranteeing that 
they at least compile with the latest API, and making it easier to test that 
they really work.
- Wherever interfaces are mentioned, there will be a links to online API 
reference documentation (assuming that it exists) and links to relevant parts 
of the Telapathy specification.

<chapter id="chapter-basics">
  <title>Basics</title>

  <para>This chapter introduces some basic techniques and concepts that you must understand to use Telepathy confidently. You should read through this chapter before proceeding, but you will probably want to refer back here again later.</para>

  <sect1 id="sec-basics-dbus">
    <title>Using D-Bus</title>
    <para>Telepathy is a <indexterm><primary>D-Bus</primary></indexterm> API. Telepathy components conform to the <ulink url="&url_spec;">Telepathy D-Bus Specification</ulink>, which is therefore also the main Telepathy API reference.</para>
    <para>D-Bus is an <indexterm><primary>IPC</primary></indexterm> (Inter-process communication) system, allowing different software components to be implemented in different processes, with different programming languages. It also allows multiple applications to easily share functionality from a single process. Most examples in this book will use <link linkend="sec-basics-language-bindings">language bindings</link> instead of using D-Bus directly. However, an understanding of the following D-Bus concepts will help you even when using language bindings.</para>
 
     <variablelist>

       <varlistentry>
         <term>
           <indexterm><primary>Bus Name</primary></indexterm>
           Bus Name
         </term>
         <listitem>
           <para>A process can make a service available by connecting to a D-Bus <literal>bus</literal> and requesting a &quot;well-known&quot; <literal>bus name</literal> for the connection, such as &quot;com.mycompany.TextEditor&quot;, by which other processes, such as applications, can access it.</para>
         </listitem>
       </varlistentry>

       <varlistentry>
         <term>
           <indexterm><primary>Object Path</primary></indexterm>
           Object Path
         </term>
         <listitem>
           <para>The service process provides D-Bus objects on that bus name. Each object has an <literal>object path</literal>, such as &quot;/com/company/TextEditor&quot;, which a client application must specify to use that object.</para>
         </listitem>
       </varlistentry>

       <varlistentry>
         <term>
           <indexterm><primary>Interface Name</primary></indexterm>
           Bus Name
         </term>
         <listitem>
           <para>Each D-Bus object implements one or more D-Bus interfaces. Each interface has an <literal>interface name</literal>, such as &quot;com.mycompany.TextEditor&quot;. Each interface provides one or more methods or signals, each with a member name.</para>
         </listitem>
       </varlistentry>

    </variablelist>

    <para>Of course, for simple services with just one object that provides just one interface, these three names will often  look very similar.</para>

    <para>In the following sections you will see how a D-Bus API can be used from some common programming languages. In these examples, we use the FreeDesktop <literal>Notification</literal> system, which should be available on most modern Linux installations. The examples should cause a message to popup from your desktop panel. Note that, like Telepathy, this service is available on the <indexterm><primary><literal>Session Bus</literal></primary></indexterm> rather than the <indexterm><primary><literal>System Bus</literal></primary></indexterm>. Services on the <literal>Session Bus</literal> are for the current user's session only. Services on the <literal>System Bus</literal> are shared between all users.</para>

    <para>These programming languages allow you to call D-Bus methods synchronously, meaning that they block until they can return the method's result. However, that is generally disapproved of because the D-Bus service may take a long time to reply, and because of some fundamental technical problems with the use of blocking calls between processes. Therefore, the examples call the D-Bus method asynchronously, theoretically allowing the application to continue with other tasks while waiting for the result.</para> 
    <!-- TODO: Get the result asynchronously. --> 

    <sect2 id="sec-basics-dbus-glib">
      <title>Using D-Bus from C, with glib</title>

      <para>This example uses dbus-glib's <ulink url="http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/api/html/group__DBusGLib.html#gbd4dab5f4d66ab052c15862028502caf">dbus_g_proxy_begin_call()</ulink> function to call the <literal>Notify()</literal> method on the <literal>org.freedesktop.Notification</literal> interface of the desktop notification service at the <literal>/org/freedesktop/Notification</literal> path. Note that we must specify the types of each parameter.</para>
      <para>We could have used the synchronous <ulink url="http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/api/html/group__DBusGLib.html#ge38c0fb788e874fcf88489c961480f38">dbus_g_proxy_call()</ulink> function instead but, as already mentioned, asynchronous calls are generally preferred with D-Bus.</para>

   <sect1 id="sec-basics-language-bindings">
    <title>Language Bindings</title>
    <para>As mentioned in the <link linkend="sec-basics-dbus">Using D-Bus</link> section, many programming languages have their own generic ways of using D-Bus APIs. In addition, there are some Telepathy-specific APIs to make the use of Telepathy even easier. For instance, <ulink url="http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/wiki/Telepathy%20GLib">telepathy-glib</ulink> provides an API that is familiar to users of Glib and GTK+, using the GObject system and related conventions.</para>
    <para>Likewise, the <ulink url="http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/wiki/TelepathyQt">Telepathy-Qt</ulink> project provides a more Qt-like API for Telepathy and <ulink url="http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/wiki/Telepathy%20Python">Telepathy-Python</ulink> does the same for Python.</para> <!-- TODO: Link to Telepathy-Qt4 when it is ready. -->
  
    <sect2 id="sec-basics-language-bindings-telepathy-glib">
      <title>telepathy-glib</title>
      <para>The C examples in this book will use telepathy-glib.</para>

    </sect2>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="sec-basics-connection-managers">
    <title>Connection Managers</title>
    <para>Support for the various communication protocols is provided by various <literal>Connection Managers</literal>. For instance, the <literal>telepathy-gabble</literal> Connection Manager provides support for the <acronym>XMPP</acronym> protocol, also known as <literal>Jabber</literal>.</para>
    <para>There is no central &app; D-Bus service. Instead there are several connection manager services, activated on demand, and each of these connection managers provide the same core set of D-Bus interfaces, such as <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Connection">Connection</ulink> and <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Channel">Channel</ulink>, allowing application code to be written generically for all connection managers.</para>
  </sect1>

  <!-- TODO: Notes: The interfaces are often called their type, particularly for channels. Explain. -->
  <!-- TODO: Is it only Connection that has optional interfaces? -->
  <sect1 id="sec-basics-optional-interfaces">
    <title>Optional Interfaces</title>
    <para>Although a core set of D-Bus interfaces is provided by all connection managers, some extra D-Bus interfaces are optional. For instance, some connection managers only provide extra interfaces when it discovers that the remote server provides that optional functionality. Therefore, when using these interfaces, application code should first check that the interface is available, sometimes falling back to alternative interfaces. Use the Connection interface's <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Connection.GetInterfaces"><function>GetInterfaces()</function></ulink> method for this.</para>

    <note>
    <para>Note that the <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Connection.GetInterfaces"><function>Connection.GetInterfaces()</function></ulink> method  does more than the standard D-Bus <ulink url="http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#standard-interfaces-introspectable"><function>Introspectable.Introspect()</function></ulink> method. <function>GetInterfaces()</function> allows tools and language bindings to know about the possible availability of interfaces via <function>Introspect()</function> while providing an additional check that the interface is really supported for the particular connection manager with the particular remote server to which that connection manager is connected.

      methods may access the network.
      (This convention seems to apply to the D-Bus API, but not to the telepathy-glib API. murrayc)
    - Many Get* methods are being deprecated in favour of D-Bus properties 
      currently (because you can do GetAll() for a given interface and download 
      the state at once with fewer roundtrips).

  <title>Accounts and AccountManager</title>
  <para>TODO:
   Notes:
   - This is described in the telepathy specification but only partially 
     implemented in Nokia mission control.
   - AccountManager contains a list of my accounts (my jabber account, my 
     ICQ account, etc)
   - This is  a desktop-wide list of accounts shared by all applications (via 
     the Mission Control service)
     - most developers probably won't need to deal with them much.
   - This is not a list of remote accounts held by my contacts.
   - Includes the parameters which are passed to RequestConnection().
   - Includes some other parameters such as your avatar/your alias, which the 
     AccountManager takes care of setting for you
   - Responds to connectivity events/requests.

   Notes:
   - This is in mission control.
   - This dispatches some events to applications that care about them, by 
     calling a method on the ChannelHandler interface (that the application 
     implements). This API is currently in flux.

<chapter id="chapter-connection-manager">
  <title>Connection Manager</title>
  <para>TODO:
   Notes:
   - Provides protocol implementations, allowing telepathy to use additional IM 
     types, for instance.
   - This has connections.
   - This is not used much by developers, but the list of connection managers 
     should be offered by the desktop-wide accounts UI.
  </para>
</chapter>

<chapter id="chapter-connection">
  <title>Connection</title>
  <para>TODO:
   Notes:
   - This is my connection to my IM account.
   - A connection has <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Channel">Channel</ulink>s.
   - Connection gives me several <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Channel.Type.ContactList">ContactList</ulink> Channels (subscribe, publish, etc)
     - Provides a <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Channel.Interface.Group">Group</ulink> interface.
       - Contains many members (Contact handles). Note that there is no Contact interface or object (just a handle), for performance reasons.
   - Has several optional interfaces (Avatars, Presence, etc).
     - And some optional interfaces that just improve similar existing interfaces, such as <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Connection.Interface.Requests">Connection.Interface.Requests</ulink>
       instead of <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Connection.RequestChannel">Connection.RequestChannel</ulink>
   - Provides a <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Connection.Interface.SimplePresence">SimplePresence</ulink> interface, to which I can give a contact handle 
     to discover if that contact is online. The SimplePresence interface emits 
     signals when contacts' presence changes.
     (SimplePresence replaces the <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Connection.Interface.Presence">Presence</ulink> interface, to be deprecated soon.)
   - Similarly, the <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Connection.Interface.Avatars">Avatars</ulink> and <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Connection.Interface.Aliasing">Aliasing</ulink> interfaces on the Connection provide 
     other information about contacts, and notifications when they change. 
   - (Having interfaces on the connection rather than the contacts makes 
     overall contact handling easier.)
   - Has a <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Connection.RequestChannel">RequestChannel()</ulink> method that takes a channel type (text/voip/tubes) 
     and a handle (contact, room, list or group) handle. 
   - A new <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Connection.Interface.ContactCapabilities.DRAFT">ContactCapabilities</ulink> interface will allow retrieving of multiple 
     types of information at once (string of handle, alias, avatar, presence, etc), 
     which is more efficient.

  <para>TODO:
   Notes:
   - <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Connection.RequestChannel">Connection.RequestChannel</ulink>, <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Channel">Channel</ulink>
   - Allows data exchange between the local account and a remote IM account 
     (or group of remote accounts).
   - Only an application knows about actual people (who might have many IM 
     accounts).
   - (We need to call them something other than "IM accounts" because it is not 
     just IM. It can be "people nearby", for instance.)
   - Maybe an instance of one of these communication types: Text, Contact List, 
     Streamed Media.
   - Channel provides (maybe _is_) a contacts list. Usually 2 people (local me 
     and my remote contact), but x people for a chat group.
   - The base Channel interface provides channel type, handle and interface 
     properties, and Close method, Closed signal.
   - Plus one type-specific interface, such as Text, or Tube, Media.
   - This is also sometimes a <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Channel.Interface.Group">Group</ulink> interface, for instance if it's a group chat.
   - Optional interfaces such as Group are discovered by inspecting the 
     Interfaces property.
   - Media channels may have DTMF, Hold, CallStates (on hold, ringing, etc) 
     interfaces
   - Text channels may have ChatState (typing notification), Messages (rich 
     messages), Password interfaces
   - Mention basic channel requesting and then advanced channel requesting.
     (The new API makes it easier to do these things.)
   - You'd need two channels for two types of communication with the same 
     contact. (At least with the new API.)
   - Has capabilities. (API will change).
     - Tells me what type of channel I can open on a connection/contact. 
       For instance, text/media/tube.
