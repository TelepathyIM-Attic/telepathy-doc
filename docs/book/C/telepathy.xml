  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>The Telepathy framework allows applications to use real-time communications via several common protocols, such as XMPP (Jabber). For instance, an instant messenger application might use Telepathy to allow chats with online contacts via accounts with various IM services. Or a  game might use Telepathy to simplify the implementation of its networking code, allowing users to play against each other.</para>
  <para>Telepathy is a <ulink url="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus">D-Bus</ulink> API so it may be used from most programming languages.</para>
  <para>All this functionality is available under an open source license, allowing people to make improvements and add new features.</para>

<!--
Notes:
- The following sections describe important D-Bus API in telepathy.
These sections will describe how these interfaces can be used, including small 
code snippets.
- Where possible the documentation will pull in small but complete 
code examples which can build as part of the documentation, guaranteeing that 
they at least compile with the latest API, and making it easier to test that 
they really work.
- Wherever interfaces are mentioned, there will be a links to online API 
reference documentation (assuming that it exists) and links to relevant parts 
of the Telapathy specification.

<chapter id="chapter-basics">
  <title>Basics</title>

  <para>This chapter introduces some basic techniques and concepts that you must understand to use Telepathy confidently. You should read through this chapter before proceeding, but you will probably want to refer back here again later.</para>

  <sect1 id="sec-basics-dbus">
    <title>Using D-Bus</title>
    <para>Telepathy is a <indexterm><primary>D-Bus</primary></indexterm>D-Bus API. Telepathy components conform to the <ulink url="&url_spec;">Telepathy D-Bus Specification</ulink>, which is therefore also the main Telepathy API reference.</para>
    <para>D-Bus is an <indexterm><primary>IPC</primary></indexterm>IPC (Inter-process communication) system, allowing different software components to be implemented in different processes, with different programming languages. It also allows multiple applications to easily share functionality from a single process. Most examples in this book will use <link linkend="sec-basics-language-bindings">language bindings</link> instead of using D-Bus directly. However, an understanding of the following D-Bus concepts will help you even when using language bindings.</para>
 
     <variablelist>

       <varlistentry>
         <term>
           <indexterm><primary>Bus Name</primary></indexterm>
           Bus Name
         </term>
         <listitem>
           <para>A process can make a service available by connecting to a D-Bus <literal>bus</literal> and requesting a &quot;well-known&quot; <literal>bus name</literal> for the connection, such as &quot;com.mycompany.TextEditor&quot;, by which other processes, such as applications, can access it.</para>
         </listitem>
       </varlistentry>

       <varlistentry>
         <term>
           <indexterm><primary>Object Path</primary></indexterm>
           Object Path
         </term>
         <listitem>
           <para>The service process provides D-Bus objects on that bus name. Each object has an <literal>object path</literal>, such as &quot;/com/company/TextEditor&quot;, which a client application must specify to use that object.</para>
         </listitem>
       </varlistentry>

       <varlistentry>
         <term>
           <indexterm><primary>Interface Name</primary></indexterm>
           Interface Name
         </term>
         <listitem>
           <para>Each D-Bus object implements one or more D-Bus interface. Each interface has an <literal>interface name</literal>, such as &quot;com.mycompany.TextEditor&quot;. Each interface provides one or more method or signal, each with a member name.</para>
         </listitem>
       </varlistentry>

    </variablelist>

    <para>Of course, for simple services with just one object that provides just one interface, these three names will often look very similar.</para>

    <para>In the following sections you will see how a D-Bus API can be used from some common programming languages. Remember that these examples only create <literal>proxies</literal> to the D-Bus objects, providing a way to use their API. The actual objects are instantiated in the service's process.</para>

    <para>In these examples, we use the FreeDesktop <literal>Notification</literal> system, which should be available on most modern Linux installations. The examples should cause a message to popup from your desktop panel. Note that, like Telepathy, this service is available on the <indexterm><primary>Session Bus</primary></indexterm><literal>Session Bus</literal> rather than the <indexterm><primary>System Bus</primary></indexterm><literal>System Bus</literal>. Services on the <literal>Session Bus</literal> are for the current user's session only. Services on the <literal>System Bus</literal> are shared between all users.</para>

    <para>These programming languages allow you to call D-Bus methods synchronously, meaning that they block until they can return the method's result. However, that is generally disapproved of because the D-Bus service may take a long time to reply, and because of some fundamental technical problems with the use of blocking calls between processes. Therefore, the examples call the D-Bus method asynchronously, theoretically allowing the application to continue with other tasks while waiting for the result.</para> 
    <!-- TODO: Get the result asynchronously. -->

      <sect3 id="sect-basics-dbus-glib-methods">
        <title>Calling Methods</title>

The specified callback function then calls <ulink url="&url_dbus_glib_base;dbus-glib-DBusGProxy.html#dbus-g-proxy-end-call"><function>dbus_g_proxy_end_call()</function></ulink> to retreive the result.</para>

You can call these methods to get or set property values for the object's other interfaces.</para>
        <para>As of this writing, telepathy-glib has no simple API for dealing with properties so you must call these functions directly. Therefore this example is therefore very similar to the <link linkend="sect-basics-dbus-glib-methods">Calling Methods</link> example.</para>

   <sect1 id="sec-basics-language-bindings">
    <title>Language Bindings</title>
    <para>As mentioned in the <link linkend="sec-basics-dbus">Using D-Bus</link> section, many programming languages have their own generic ways of using D-Bus APIs. In addition, there are some Telepathy-specific APIs to make the use of Telepathy even easier. For instance, <ulink url="http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/wiki/Telepathy%20GLib">telepathy-glib</ulink> provides an API that is familiar to users of Glib and GTK+, using the GObject system and related conventions.</para>
    <para>Likewise, the <ulink url="http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/wiki/TelepathyQt">Telepathy-Qt</ulink> project provides a more Qt-like API for Telepathy and <ulink url="http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/wiki/Telepathy%20Python">Telepathy-Python</ulink> does the same for Python.</para> <!-- TODO: Link to Telepathy-Qt4 when it is ready. -->

    <para>Remember that, like raw use of D-Bus from these programming languages, the Telepathy language bindings only create <literal>proxies</literal> to the D-Bus objects, providing a way to use their API. The actual objects are instantiated in the service's process.</para>
  
    <sect2 id="sec-basics-language-bindings-telepathy-glib">
      <title>telepathy-glib</title>
      <para>The C examples in this book will use telepathy-glib, which provides a GObject-based API for the Telepathy framework.</para>

      <!-- TODO: Mention this? 
      <para>The reference documentation only makes sense in terms of the Telepathy D-Bus Specification.</para>
      -->

      <sect3 id="sec-basics-language-bindings-telepathy-glib-async">
        <title>Asynchronous Calls</title>
        <para>For each Telepathy D-Bus method, telepathy-glib generally provides both a &quot;run&quot; and a &quot;call&quot; function. For instance, <ulink url="&url_telepathy_glib_base;connection.html#tp-cli-connection-run-connect">tp_cli_connection_run_connect()</ulink> and <ulink url="&url_telepathy_glib_base;connection.html#tp-cli-connection-call-connect">tp_cli_connection_call_connect()</ulink>. The &quot;run&quot; function is synchronous, blocking until the D-Bus service has returned the value, whereas the &quot;call&quot; function is asynchronous, immediately returning and later providing the result to a callback function.</para>
        <para>However, the Telepathy developers strongly discourage the use of the &quot;run&quot; functions, so all examples in this book will use the asynchronous &quot;call&quot; functions. This complicates application code but it is more robust and allows the application to be more responsive, doing more than one thing at a time.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="sec-basics-language-bindings-telepathy-glib-generated">
        <title>Generated Functions</title>
        <para>telepathy-glib provides both hand-coded and generated API. The generated functions have these prefixes:</para>

        <variablelist>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>tp_cli_</term> 
            <listitem>
              <para>These functions are useful for client applications. For instance, <ulink url="&url_telepathy_glib_base;connection.html#tp-cli-connection-run-connect">tp_cli_connection_run_connect()</ulink>.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>tp_svc_</term> 
            <listitem>
              <para>These functions are useful for service implementations, such as connection managers. For instance, <ulink url="&url_telepathy_glib_base;svc-connection.html#tp-svc-connection-implement-connect">tp_svc_connection_implement_connect()</ulink>.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>

        </variablelist>

        <para>The generated functions make simple direct calls to the D-Bus methods, without any additional logic and without using more appropriate types. For instance, they use unsigned integers for parameters because D-Bus does not have a concept of enumerations. However, the Telepathy D-Bus Specification does describe enumerations of possible values for these parameters, so the hand-written functions do use enums. Likewise, raw D-Bus methods can only identify object instances in terms of a <literal>bus name</literal> and <literal>object path</literal> combination, but telepathy-glib can directly provide a GObject instance that is a proxy for a D-Bus object without exposing those intermediate details.</para>
        <para>Hand-coded functions have a simple <literal>tp_</literal> prefix and should be preferred whenever they exist. The generated functions exist only because hand-written functions have not yet been implemented for all Telepathy D-Bus methods.</para>  
        <para>In addition to more pleasant syntax, some hand-written objects contain a large amount of useful logic which can simplify application code. For instance, <ulink url="&url_telepathy_glib_base;contact.html"><classname>TpContact</classname></ulink> uses GObject signals. <!-- TODO: Finish this sentence. --></para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
        <title>Instantiation and Readiness</title>
        <!-- TODO: Keep any eye on http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13422 -->
        <para>Some of the hand-coded objects, such as <ulink url="&url_telepathy_glib_base;connection.html"><classname>TpConnection</classname></ulink> and <ulink url="&url_telepathy_glib_base;connection.html"><classname>TpChannel</classname></ulink>, call additional D-Bus methods to acquire necessary information. When they have received this information they are then &quot;ready&quot;, meaning that other hand-written functions can then be called. This concept of &quot;readiness&quot; does not exist in the raw D-Bus API because it describes the status of the hand-written behaviour. For instance, you should call <ulink url="&url_telepathy_glib_base;connection.html#tp-connection-call-when-ready">tp_connection_call_when_ready()</ulink> after instantiating a TpConnection, or <ulink url="&url_telepathy_glib_base;channel.html#tp-channel-call-when-ready">tp_channel_call_when_ready()</ulink> after instantiating a TpChannel.</para>

      </sect3>

      <sect3>
        <title>Headers and Linking</title>
        <para>To use the telepathy-glib API, you must include the headers for the library, and link to its shared library. The necessary compiler and linker commands can be obtained from the <literal>pkg-config</literal> utiltity like so:</para>
        <para>
<programlisting>
pkg-config telepathy-glib --cflags
pkg-config telepathy-glib --libs
</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>However, if you are using the &quot;autotools&quot; (automake, autoconf, etc) build system, you will find it more convenient to use the <function>PKG_CHECK_MODULES</function> macro in your <literal>configure.ac</literal> file.
       </para>
       <para>
<programlisting>
PKG_CHECK_MODULES(EXAMPLE, telepathy-glib)
AC_SUBST(EXAMPLE_CFLAGS)
AC_SUBST(EXAMPLE_LIBS)
</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>You should then use the generated _CFLAGS and _LIBS definitions in your Makefile.am files.</para>
      </sect3>

    </sect2>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="sec-basics-connection-managers">
    <title>Connection Managers</title>
    <para>Support for the various communication protocols is provided by several <literal>Connection Managers</literal>. For instance, the <literal>telepathy-gabble</literal> Connection Manager provides support for the <acronym>XMPP</acronym> protocol, also known as <literal>Jabber</literal>.</para>
    <para>There is no central &app; D-Bus service. Instead there are several connection manager services, activated on demand, and each of these connection managers provide the same core set of D-Bus interfaces, such as <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Connection"><interfacename>Connection</interfacename></ulink> and <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Channel"><interfacename>Channel</interfacename></ulink>, allowing application code to be written generically for all connection managers.</para>
  </sect1>

  <!-- TODO: Notes: The interfaces are often called their type, particularly for channels. Explain. -->
  <sect1 id="sec-basics-optional-interfaces">
    <title>Optional Interfaces</title>
    <para>Although a core set of D-Bus interfaces is provided by all connection managers, some extra D-Bus interfaces are optional. For instance, some connection managers only provide extra interfaces when they discover that the remote server provides that optional functionality. Therefore, when using these interfaces, application code should first check that the interface is available, sometimes falling back to alternative interfaces.</para>
    <para>For instance, use the <interfacename>Connection</interfacename> interface's <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Connection.GetInterfaces"><methodname>GetInterfaces()</methodname></ulink> method. For <interfacename>ConnectionManager</interfacename>s and <interfacename>Channel</interfacename>s use their <property>Interfaces</property> D-Bus property. Eventually <interfacename>Connection</interfacename> will also have an <property>Interfaces</property> property, when its <methodname>GetInterfaces()</methodname> method will be deprecated.</para>

    <para>When using telepathy-glib, you can simply call the <ulink url="&url_telepathy_glib_base;proxy.html#tp-proxy-has-interface"><function>tp_proxy_has_interface()</function></ulink> function for <classname>TpConnectionManager</classname>, <classname>TpConnection</classname>, or <classname>TpChannel</classname>.</para> 
    <para>Actually, the core interfaces are only &quot;recommended&quot; by the Telepathy D-Bus specification so you should check before using any interface even if it is not commonly considered to be optional.</para>

    <note>
    <para>Note that the <property>Interfaces</property> property (or the <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Connection.GetInterfaces"><methodname>Connection.GetInterfaces()</methodname></ulink> method) does more than the standard D-Bus <ulink url="&url_dbus_spec_base;standard-interfaces-introspectable"><methodname>Introspectable.Introspect()</methodname></ulink> method. The Telepathy-specific mechanism allows tools and language bindings to know about the possible availability of interfaces via <methodname>Introspect()</methodname> while providing an additional check that the interface is really supported for the particular connection manager with the particular remote server to which that connection manager is connected.

    <title>Handles</title>
    <para>The Telepathy D-Bus API does not have D-Bus objects to represent contacts, groups, or rooms. These are instead identified by numeric <literal>handles</literal>. This is for performance reasons, and because it is easier to compare numeric handles than to discover if two D-Bus proxy objects refer to the same object instance.</para>
    <para>These numeric handles are only unique within a Telepathy Connection. For instance, don't try to use a Connection's contact handle with a different Connection. The handles also only make sense when combined with a <ulink url="&url_spec;#type-Handle_Type">handle type</ulink>, telling the API whether it represents a contact, group, or list. In fact, two handles may be numerically identical but be for different types.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Hold and Release</title>
      <para>When a Telepathy object has finished with a handle that number may be forgotten and even reused later as a handle for a completely different item. However, your application may wish to &quot;hold&quot; the handle for a longer time. To do so, you should call the Connection's <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Connection.HoldHandles"><methodname>HoldHandles()</methodname></ulink> method and call <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Connection.ReleaseHandles"><methodname>ReleaseHandles()</methodname></ulink> when you have finished with the handle. However, a single <methodname>ReleaseHandles()</methodname> call will release a handle regardless of how many times <methodname>HoldHandles()</methodname> has been called, so be careful not to call it while other code may be using the handle.</para>

      <para>This is less necessary when using Telepathy <link linkend="sec-basics-language-bindings">language bindings</link>, such as telepathy-glib, because they may automatically hold and release handles for the lifetime of their objects, such as telepathy-glib's <classname>TpContact</classname> object. Additionally, telepathy-glib wraps the <methodname>HoldHandles()</methodname> and <methodname>ReleaseHandles()</methodname> D-Bus methods with the <ulink url="&url_telepathy_glib_base;connection.html#tp-connection-hold-handles"><function>tp_connection_hold_handles()</function></ulink> and <ulink url="&url_telepathy_glib_base;connection.html#tp-connection-unref-handles"><function>tp_connection_unref_handles()</function></ulink> functions which reference-count the client-side handle &quot;hold&quot;, allowing you to match each <function>tp_connection_hold_handles()</function> call with a call to <function>tp_connection_release_handles()</function>.</para>

      <!-- TODO: On irc, smcv said: "perhaps "the user types in the name of a chatroom to join" would be a better example of when you want to use tp_connection_request_handles/tp_connection_unref_handles". Explain that more fully. -->

  <title>Connection Manager</title>

  <para>As mentioned in the <link linkend="sec-basics-connection-managers">Basics</link> chapter, each <ulink url="&url_spec_base;ConnectionManager"><interfacename>ConnectionManager</interfacename></ulink> provides support for a communication protocol.</para>

  <para>All Telepathy Connection Managers have <literal>bus name</literal>s that begin with &quot;org.freedesktop.Telepathy.ConnectionManager&quot; so you can discover all available connection managers by calling the D-Bus <ulink url="&url_dbus_spec_base;bus-messages-list-activatable-names"><methodname>ListActivatableNames()</methodname></ulink> method and then comparing the names with that prefix. telepathy-glib provides the <ulink url="&url_telepathy_glib_base;connection-manager.html#tp-list-connection-managers"><function>tp_list_connection_managers()</function></ulink> function that conveniently does this.</para>
  <para>You may then discover what protocols are provided by each connection manager by calling the ConnectionManagers's <ulink url="&url_spec_base;ConnectionManager.ListProtocols"><methodname>ListProtocols()</methodname></ulink> D-Bus method. telepathy-glib's <ulink url="&url_telepathy_glib_base;connection-manager.html"><classname>TpConnectionManager</classname></ulink> object calls this automatically and emits the <literal>got-info</literal> signal when it has returned. You can examine the TpConnectionManager::protocols struct field in your signal handler.</para>
  <para>Applications, such as IM clients, might choose to offer the user a choice from that list of protocols and then use the appropriate connection manager. Others might use only one protocol and therefore hard-code the connection manager's <literal>bus name</literal>.</para>

If the connection succeeds then this method returns the <literal>bus name</literal> and <literal>object path</literal> of a Telepathy <ulink url="&url_spec_base;Connection"><interfacename>Connection</interfacename></ulink> object.</para>

    <para>As of this writing, there is no hand-coded telepathy-glib function to request the connection and directly provide a <ulink url="&url_telepathy_glib_base;connection.html"><classname>TpConnection</classname></ulink> proxy.
