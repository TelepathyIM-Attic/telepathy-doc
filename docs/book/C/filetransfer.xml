<chapter id="chapter.filetransfer">
 <title>Transferring Files</title>
 <para>
  File transfer in Telepathy is handled using a
  <interfacename>Channel.Type.FileTransfer</interfacename> channel.
 </para>

 <para>
  The connection manager carries out file transfer via the most appropriate
  mechanism, depending on the protocol. Connection Managers do not know
  about accessing files or URLs, and it is not possible to pass file
  descriptors across D-Bus, so transfer between the client and the
  connection manager is done using a local socket (e.g. a UNIX socket or
  local IPv4 socket).
 </para>

 <para>
  The lifetime of a file transfer channel goes through several states:
  Pending, Accepted, Open and Completed (or Cancelled). This is shown in
  <xref linkend="fig.filetransfer.actors"/>.

  <sect2 id="sect.filetransfer.receiving.channel">
   <title>Handling The New Channel</title>

   <para>
    An incoming file transfer channel will be heralded by the
    <methodname>NewChannels</methodname> signal (as with other incoming
    channels, e.g. <link linkend="sect.messaging.messages.receiving">text
    channels</link>). The channel type of the new channel will be
    <interfacename>org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.FileTransfer</interfacename>.
   </para>

   <para>
    As well as common channel properties (e.g.
    <property>InitiatorHandle</property>, <property>InitiatorID</property>,
    <property>TargetHandle</property>, <property>TargetID</property>, etc.),
    there will be properties specific to file transfers that contain the
    metadata for the file, summarised in
    <xref linkend="table.filetransfer.receiving.props"/>. The client should
    display this information to the user when asking whether or not to
    accept the file.

  <sect2 id="table.filetransfer.receiving.accepting">
   <title>Accepting The File</title>

   <para>
    Before calling <methodname>AcceptFile</methodname>, the client should
    first connect the <methodname>FileTransferStateChanged</methodname>
    signal.
   </para>

   <para>
    <methodname>AcceptFile</methodname> takes as its arguments the type of
    socket we wish to use to transfer the file from the Connection Manager
    to the client. Different Connection Managers and different OS platforms
    might support different socket options. The property
    <property>AvailableSocketTypes</property> lists the supported socket
    types and their access modes. This property would have been passed in
    as one of the channel properties to
    <methodname>NewChannels</methodname>.
   </para>

   <para>
    <methodname>AcceptFile</methodname> also takes a requested initial
    file offset (for continuations, if a partial transfer was deemed to
    occur), or <literal>0</literal> for the whole file. Note that
    this is a <emphasis>requested</emphasis> offset, and depending on the
    protocol and sending client may not be honoured. Clients must check
    <property>InitialOffset</property> property once the channel is open.
   </para>

   <para>
    Calling <methodname>AcceptFile</methodname> will return the address of
    a socket opened by the Connection Manager and put the channel into the
    <emphasis>Pending</emphasis> state
    (<type>File_Transfer_State_Pending</type>). However, you should not
    attempt to open the socket yourself until the channel enters the
    <emphasis>Open</emphasis> state (<type>File_Transfer_State_Open</type>).
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     The socket address returned by <methodname>AcceptFile</methodname> and
     <methodname>ProvideFile</methodname> is a socket shared between the
     client and the Connection Manager. It is not the address of the socket
     between you and the remote client.
    </para>
    <para>
     The file itself is transferred by the Connection Manager using the most
     appropriate mechanism to reach the remote host, be it a peer-to-peer
     socket, SOCKS5 proxy, using ICE or in-band via the server. A Telepathy
     client doesn't have to be concerned with the mechanism.
