This documentation is written in Docbook, but is designed to be output as
HTML with `make html`.

The Docbook sources are stored in docs/book/C/, but are extensively
preprocessed by the Makefile to add things like <ulink> tags to
function/methodnames etc. and to insert syntax highlighted examples.

Crossreferencing function names is done using Devhelp indexes. To add another
cross referencing source, edit insert-links.py.

Other custom modifications, such as automatically including source code
from examples are self explanatory when you look at how it's done in the
Docbook source.
